# Gibber

Gibber is a free, federated, and open source
social network based on [ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/).

## Install

The `docker-compose.yml` file contains configuration for running a development version of Gibber.
It runs a [Next](https://nextjs.org/) server in development and a
[Garage](https://garagehq.deuxfleurs.fr/) object storage server.

Clone this repository and copy `.env.example` to `.env`, `garage.toml.example` to `garage.toml`,
and fill out your details.

Then run `docker compose up`.

To use and configure Garage with the CLI use:

```
docker exec -ti gibber-garage /garage
```

Follow the [Garage guide](https://garagehq.deuxfleurs.fr/documentation/quick-start/#creating-a-cluster-layout)
to configure a layout and a bucket. You must enable website access to the bucket.

Once the containers are running, you must run the database migrations. In order to ensure the proper binary target is generated by Prisma this should be done in the container.

```
docker exec -ti gibber-node bash
```

Run the migrations:

```
npx prisma migrate dev
```
